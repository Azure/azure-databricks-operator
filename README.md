## Introduction

Kubernetes offers the facility of extending its API through the concept of 'Operators' ([Introducing Operators: Putting Operational Knowledge into Software](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html)). This repository contains the resources and code to deploy an Azure Databricks Operator for Kubernetes.

The Databricks operator is useful in situations where Kubernetes hosted applications wish to launch and use Databricks data engineering and machine learning tasks.
