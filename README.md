> This project is experimental. Expect the API to change. It is not recommended for production environments.


## Introduction

Kubernetes offers the facility of extending its API through the concept of [Operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/). This repository contains the resources and code to deploy an Azure Databricks Operator for Kubernetes.

The Databricks operator is useful in situations where Kubernetes hosted applications wish to launch and use Databricks data engineering and machine learning tasks.

### Key benefits of using Azure Databricks operator

1. Easy to use: Azure Databricks operations can be done by using Kubectl there is no need to learn or install data bricks utils command line and it’s python dependency

2. Security: No need to distribute and use Databricks token, the data bricks token is used by operator 

3. Version control: All the YAML or helm charts which has azure data bricks operations (clusters, jobs, …) can be tracked 

4. Automation: Replicate azure data bricks operations on any data bricks workspace by applying same manifests or helm charts

The project was built using

1. [Kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/)
2. [Golang SDK for DataBricks](https://github.com/xinsnake/databricks-sdk-golang)

## How to use Azure Databricks operator

1. Download [the latest release manifests](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-databricks-operator/releases):

```sh
wget https://github.com/microsoft/azure-databricks-operator/releases/latest/download/release.zip
unzip release.zip
```

2. Create the `azure-databricks-operator-system` namespace:

```sh
kubectl create namespace azure-databricks-operator-system
```

3. Create Kubernetes secrets with values for `DATABRICKS_HOST` and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`:

```shell
kubectl --namespace azure-databricks-operator-system \
    create secret generic dbrickssettings \
    --from-literal=DatabricksHost="https://xxxx.azuredatabricks.net" \
    --from-literal=DatabricksToken="xxxxx"
```

4. Apply the manifests for the Operator and CRDs in `release/config`:

```sh
kubectl apply -f release/config
```



For details deployment guides please see [deploy.md](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-databricks-operator/blob/master/docs/deploy.md)

## Samples 

1. Create a spark cluster on demand and run a databricks notebook.
