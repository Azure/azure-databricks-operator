# Azure Databricks operator (for Kubernetes)

> This project is experimental. Expect the API to change. It is not recommended for production environments.

## Introduction

Kubernetes offers the facility of extending it's API through the concept of 'Operators' ([Introducing Operators: Putting Operational Knowledge into Software](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html)). This repository contains the resources and code to deploy an Azure Databricks Operator for Kubernetes.

It is a Kubernetes controller that watches Customer Resource Definitions (CRDs) that define a Databricks job.

![alt text](docs/images/azure-databricks-operator.jpg "high level architecture")

The Databricks operator is useful in situations where Kubernetes hosted applications wish to launch and use Databricks data engineering and machine learning tasks.

The project was built using

1. [Kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/)
2. [Golang SDK for DataBricks](https://github.com/xinsnake/databricks-sdk-golang)
